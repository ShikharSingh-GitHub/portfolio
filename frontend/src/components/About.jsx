        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate and dedicated software developer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, currently expanding my expertise in data engineering. With a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Medicaps Institute of Science and Technology, I have honed my skills in modern web technologies like MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS. My problem-solving abilities are sharpened by solving 500+ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, and I have a keen interest in creating fluid user experiences. Through my journey at Scaler, Iâ€™ve not only deepened my understanding of software development but also embraced new challenges in data engineering. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy tackling complex problems, and am continuously driven to learn and grow in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
